#### The app includes the following main components:

* A local database that servers as a single source of truth for data presented to the user. 
* A web api service.

* A ViewModel that provides data specific for the UI.
* The UI, which shows a visual representation of the data in the ViewModel.

#### App Packages
* <b>network</b> - contains the api classes to make api calls to MovieDB server, using Retrofit. 
* <b>db</b> - contains the db classes to cache network data.
* <b>repository</b> - contains the repository classes, responsible for triggering api requests and saving the response in the database.
* <b>di</b> - contains dependency injection classes, using Dagger2.   
* <b>ui</b> - contains classes needed to display Activity and Fragment.
* <b>util</b> - contains classes needed for activity/fragment redirection.
